## The Last Consumer

A card game about privacy, consumerism, and surveillance capitalism, *The Last Consumer* is perfect for those who are looking to spice up their next dinner party/game night with some discourse. Play as either "The Last Consumer", the last person on earth who has managed to evade surveillance, or as a part of "The Agency", tasked with creating a profile on The Last Consumer by any means necessary. There is no win or lose condition, instead the goal of "The Last Consumer" is for "The Consumer" to avoid detection for as long as possible.

Available in physical print and play form and as a playingcards.io file on itch.io [here](https://drslowpokephd.itch.io/the-last-consumer-cg).
