## I left Earth because I have no friends
I left Earth because I have no friends came out of a desire to make a game that could communicate the feeling of giving up that I felt after a falling out with my college friend group. During this period of my life, I wished I could leave earth behind and start a new life among the stars. It is an intensely personal game, and one that I am particularly proud of. The game takes only about 15 minutes for a single playthrough, and contains multiple endings. Made in Twine.
