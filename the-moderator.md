## The Moderator
The Moderator is a game about the most thankless job on earth, being a social media moderator. Set in the fictional Metropolis of Angel City, tensions run high as a referendum on the independence of the city is taking place. The game grapples with themes of political interference, police violence, abortion access, and a general sense of unease. But no matter what happens, rent is due at the end of the month. The Concept for this game came out of a period of my own personal dissatisfaction with the way social media is portrayed in narrative works, often it is seen as a character in it of itself rather than as a complex system home to multiple sub-communities. 

I worked on this game entirely solo, doing all of the programming, writing, gameplay design, and visual design on my own. It was made using the Phaser game framework for Javascript.

The source code for the original build of the game is available on my [github](https://github.com/DrSlowpokePhd) profile, as well as a zipped archive of the game.

The game is currently in pre-production for a larger release that will feature more gameplay and more story over the span of 7 days.
