## Push n' Pull

Push n' Pull is the last game I made for CMPM 170. It is a collection of levels made in puzzlescript designed to teach the player the mechanics of the game without explicitly saying what they are at all. I worked alone on this project, doing all of the gameplay design, level design, programming, art, and sound design. 

It's highly reccomended that you play this game without knowing any of the rules regarding interactions with objects, as this is the intended experience of the game. For those interested in learning more about my design process while making Push n' Pull, read my blog post about it. 

If you are interested you can play Push n' Pull [here](Builds/PushNPull/push-n-pull.html).
