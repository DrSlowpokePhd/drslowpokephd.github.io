## Push n' Pull

Push n' Pull is the last game I made for CMPM 170. It is a collection of levels made in puzzlescript designed to teach the player the mechanics of the game without explicitly saying what they are at all. I worked alone on this project, doing all of the gameplay design, level design, programming, art, and sound design. 

If you are interested you can play Push n' Pull [here](Builds/PushNPull/push-n-pull.html).
