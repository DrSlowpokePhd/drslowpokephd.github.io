## Solus Core
My senior capstone game for CMPM 171, Solus Core is a third-person action game where you fight against waves of enemies attacking a central core structure. I worked on this project as a gameplay programmer, mostly working on environmental interactions and the wave system in the game. This system used JSON files to define when and where enemies would spawn on the map.

Solus core was made using the Unity3D game engine.

If you would like to play Solus Core, you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OUurHEvbG-594oHsDnOQQgGHuyhi7tTF/view?usp=sharing). Note that the game is currently only available for Windows PCs.
