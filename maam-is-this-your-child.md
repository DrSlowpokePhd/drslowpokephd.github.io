## Ma'am is this your child?

Made for Global Game Jam 2021, *Ma'am is this your child?* is a playful arcade style action game where you play as a Groccery worker tasked with returning children lost throughout the store to their parents. I worked on this project as a gameplay programmer, using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine.

You can play it on itch.io [here](https://captain-joystick.itch.io/maam-is-this-your-child)
