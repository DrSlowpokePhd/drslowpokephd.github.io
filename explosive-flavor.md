## Explosive Flavor
A game that I worked on in the first split of CMPM 170, Explosive Flavor is a detective mystery about finding out who murdered the Headmaster Parsennon White. The game opens to the headmaster greeting you, swiftly followed by his head exploding. Despite being a mere health inspector, it is up to you to find out who was behind all of this. I wrote the character Frank Ribbet, an anthropomorphic frog on the run from the French Government for reasons unknown. 

You can play Explosive Flavor for yourself [here](Builds/ExplosiveFlavor/index.html).
